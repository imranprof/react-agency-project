We love to bring designs to life as a developer, and I aim to do this using whatever front end tools aren't necessary. 
my preferred tools are more moderns JavaScript libraries like React.js but I like use whatever best for the websites needs. 
There are several reasons why a business would consider a rebrand and it doesn't necessarily mean the business has been unsuccessful.

But in order that you may see whence all this born error of those who accuse pleasure and praise pain will open the whole matter, 
and explain the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and, as it's were, 
the architect of a happy life.

Always ready to push the boundaries, especially when it comes to our own platform, 
Our analytical eye create a site that was visually engaging and also optimised for maximum performance.

Just like other pseudo-elements and pseudo-class selectors, :not() can be chained with other pseudon classes and pseudo-elements. 
For example, the following will add a “New!” word to list items that do not have a .old class name, using the ::after pseudo-element:

<div className="mt-[30px] md:mt-[30px]">
  <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/img-s-28.webp" alt="code_snip" className="w-full"/>
